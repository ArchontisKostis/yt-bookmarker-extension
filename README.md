The YTBookmarker extension helps you save time when watching a YouTube Video. It makes every video on YouTube behave like a book where you can easily bookmark a specific spot on a video. After bookmarking a spot you can easily navigate to this individual timestamp whenever you want. <br><br>
All bookmarks are synced with your Google Chrome account, so you can view the bookmarks when you come back to a previously watched video. <br>

The extension currently works only on Google Chrome.

- [Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/)
