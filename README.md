The YTBookmarker extension helps you save time when watching a YouTube Video. It makes every video on YouTube behave like a book where you can easily bookmark a specific timestamp of the video. After bookmarking a timestamp you can easily navigate to this individual timestamp whenever you are watching a video. <br><br>
All bookmarks are synced with your Google Chrome account, so you can view the bookmarks when you come back to a previously watched video. <br>

The extension currently works only on Google Chrome.

## APIs
This extension uses the following (chrome) API's:
- [Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/)
- [Runtime](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/)
- [Storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/)

## How to use the Extension
### First things first
When you add the extension to chrome and navigate to a YouTube video page you will see the Add Bookmark icon just next to the left YouTube video controls.

To save a Timestamp just click on this icon! <br>

If you want to see your saved bookmarks follow these steps:
- When at Google Chrome click on the Extensions Icon (hint it is a puzzle icon)
- On the popup menu find the YT Bookmarker Extension and click on it.
- This will reveal the extensions user interface. If you have saved any bookmarks for a video they will be displayed there.
- You can "pin" the extension to have it always appear next to chrome's search bar. Don't know how to do it? [See how to pin an extension](www.google.com)
